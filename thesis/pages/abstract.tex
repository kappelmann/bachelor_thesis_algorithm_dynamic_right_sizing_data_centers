A significant fraction of modern data centers' energy costs is due to their high energy consumption during periods of low load. One possible solution to deal with this waste of energy is to dynamically adjust the number of active servers and distribution of workloads, that is to dynamically right-size the data center. In this thesis, we derive solutions capable of finding approximative as well as optimal solutions for this dynamic right-sizing process. For this, we reduce the data centers' scheduling problem to shortest path problems of acyclic graphs. All developed algorithms are proved for correctness and made accessible by using pseudo-code that can be easily transferred to arbitrary programming languages.
