I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Albers for giving me the chance to write my thesis at her chair and supervising me open-heartedly. Moreover, I want to thank my advisor Jens Quedenfeld for TODO taking his time to answer my questions and checking my proofs.

Since this thesis constitutes the finishing line of my life in Munich for the time being, I want to express my gratitude towards my friends who made the last three years not only an integral part of my academic development but also of my personal life. I especially want to thank Benedikt Wiberg, Cedric Fromm, Dominique Bau, Elisabeth Fraberger, Gilles Tanson, Jonathan Haudenschild, Lukas Stevens, and Niklas Rosenstein for their shared time, happiness, and consolation. \emph{I wish you all the best, and I am going to miss you.}

Lastly, I want to thank my sister, Janet Kappelmann, for being the most supportive person of my life, and my parents, Erika and Hans-JÃ¼rgen Kappelmann, for their unconditional love. \emph{Thank you for believing in me.}
