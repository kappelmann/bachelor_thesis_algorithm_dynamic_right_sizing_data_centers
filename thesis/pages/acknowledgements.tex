I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Albers for giving me the chance to write my thesis at her chair and supervising me open-heartedly. Moreover, I want to thank my advisor Jens Quedenfeld for generously taking his time to answer my questions, checking my proofs, and giving me great suggestions for improvements.

I would also like to thank my family: my sister, Janet Kappelmann, for being the most supportive person of my life, and my parents, Erika and Hans-Jürgen Kappelmann, for their unconditional love, trust, and support. \emph{Thank you for believing in me.}

Finally, since this thesis constitutes the finishing line of my life in Munich for the time being, I want to express my gratitude towards my friends who made the last three years not only an integral part of my academic development but also of my personal life. Thank you for your shared time, happiness, and consolation. \emph{I wish you all the best, and I am going to miss you.}
