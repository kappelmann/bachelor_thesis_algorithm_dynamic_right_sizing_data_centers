\chapter{Approximative offline scheduling}
In this section, we derive two optimal offline algorithms based on our preliminary work.
First, we reduce our problem specified by $\inp$ to a shortest path problem of a level structured graph $G$. We then proceed to find a shortest path in $G$ and thereby an optimal schedule for $\inp$ in pseudo-polynomial time $\Theta(Tm^2)$.
After that, we refine our initial approach to derive an improved algorithm with pseudo-linear complexity $\Theta(Tm)$.
